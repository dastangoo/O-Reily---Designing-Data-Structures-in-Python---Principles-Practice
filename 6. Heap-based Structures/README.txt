Module 5 Heap-based Structures

Change Log

2015.07.31    Original implementation in dijkstra.py used G.nodes() to get nodes. 
              Since we restrict to specific range, changed to range(len(G)).
              This was done primarily to allow us to use this class
              unchanged in the next module (6. Graph Representation)
