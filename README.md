# python-data-structures
This repository contains the code associated with the "Designing Data Structures in Python: Principles &amp; Practice" Safari Video

The order of the videos in the final short course is listed below

   1. Fundamentals
   2. Ubiquitous Lists
   3. Pointer Structures
   4. Recursive Structures
   5. Heap-based Structures
   6. Graph Representation
   7. Spatial Data Structures

The first model sets the foundation for the course, presenting a brief
synopsis of the Python built-in types and time complexity analysis. Module
two describes the strengths and weaknesses of Python's list type.

The remaining modules introduce different data types, such as Stacks,
Queues, Linked Lists, Circular Buffer, Binary Search Tree, Balanced Binary
Search Tree, Heaps, Binary Heaps, KD-Trees, and Quad Trees.

Each module presents fundamental data structures and provides code examples
demonstrating their applciation and performance. All data types are
provided with sample code and unit tests.

All code examples assumes a standard installation of Python 3.  Module 6,
"Graph Representation", includes an example of a 3rd party library,
pygraph, that you can install separately.
